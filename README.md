# Ticatoe

Ticatoe is a Discord bot created using Kotlin, Maven and JDA.

The one and only command of this bot is **!tictactoe**, which you can be used to play against another person by mentioning them.
*Example: !tictactoe @Jake*

Once this command is used, both players must react with 👍 to a verification message to play or 👎 to not play.

Arrow reaction controls such as ⬆, ⬇, etc. are used to move a cursor. A move is made by reacting with the cursor's emoji. Both players must react with 🤝 if they want a draw.

Reaction controls inspired by [Sokobot by PolyMars](https://github.com/PolyMarsDev/Sokobot).
